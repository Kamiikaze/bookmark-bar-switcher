# Bookmark Bar Switcher

Bookmark Bar Switcher is a Chrome extension which allows users to conveniently switch between bookmarks using the
extension popup or keyboard shortcuts.

**The extension can be installed from
the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bookmark-bar-switcher/ogcdabloogpipelcphkhajkaneclpnlk).**

## Inspiration

The development of this extension was inspired by the
original [Bookmark-Bar-Switcher](https://github.com/zoeesilcock/Bookmark-Bar-Switcher). Sadly, it does not work with the
current version of Chrome any longer. Therefore, I have developed a new app using Vue.js with TypeScript and Bootstrap
recreating and extending the functionality of the original.

## How to use

### Switch with mouse

All available bookmark bars will show up in the extension popup.
To switch bars, just click the bookmark bar you would
like to switch to.

### Switch with keyboard shortcuts

Alternatively, you can also switch using keyboard shortcuts:

* **CTRL + Arrow-Up/Down:** Switch to the next or previous bookmark bar.
* **CTRL + SHIFT + 1:** Switch to the first bookmark bar.
* **CTRL + SHIFT + 2:** Switch to the second bookmark bar.

Additional shortcuts are available. To assign them visit ***chrome://extensions/shortcuts***.

### Edit bookmark bars

You can add, rename, reorder and remove bookmark bars directly from inside the extension:

* **Add:** Type the name of your new bar into the input field at the bottom and confirm with ***ENTER*** or by pressing
  the ***ADD*** button.
* **Edit:** Either use the ***EDIT*** button next to the bar you want to edit or double-click it. Type your new name and
  confirm with ***ENTER*** or by pressing the ***SAVE*** button.
* **Reorder:** Drag the bookmark bar to its desired position with your mouse and drop it there.
* **Remove:** Enter the ***EDIT*** mode and press the ***DELETE*** button.

## How it works

The extension exchanges the bookmarks inside the current bookmark bar with the ones within a chosen folder in
***"Bookmark Bars"***.
The current bookmark bar will be backed up to a folder in "Bookmark Bars".
I suggest renaming your current
bookmark bar as it will be called ***"default"*** when you first install the extension.

## What the future holds

The extension is still in development, and I will try to add additional features bit by bit when I have time.

### Recent changes:

* Migration to Vue.js.
* Addition of features to add, edit and remove bookmark bars from inside the extension.
* Reordering of bookmark bars through drag and drop.

### Upcoming:
* Make extension compatible with other browsers like Opera and Firefox.

**The extension has now been released to
the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bookmark-bar-switcher/ogcdabloogpipelcphkhajkaneclpnlk).
